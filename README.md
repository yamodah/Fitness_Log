# Mobile Fitness App

### React Native Mobile application built for logging fitness activity and tracking. Built for personal privacy and ease of access to personal data.


I set out to build a fitness activity log for my phone. I know these exists but I had a specific set of things I wanted to ask myself after every fitness activity. I also hated how hard it was to access my complete fitness history on a majority of fitness apps. Although two relatively small gripes, it made no sense to not make it knowing I had the tools and with enough beard stroking and googling I could piece together an app that asked what I wanted, showed me what I wanted, and as plus it did not sell my information to the highest bidder. 

This is the working demo with some very basic styling. I do not plan on publishing this on the App Store this was primarily a personal endeavor to test my ability to use a framework I had no schooling on and build something for myself. Please share any critiques/suggestions/questions you have !
